| [dns-cache-snoop.nse](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/dns-cache-snoop.nse) | intrusive,discovery  |  Performs DNS cache snooping against a DNS server.There are two modes of operation, controlled by the[code]dns-cache-snoop.mode[/code] script argument. In[code]nonrecursive[/code] mode (the default), queries are sent to theserver with the RD (recursion desired) flag set to 0. The server shouldrespond positively to these only if it has the domain cached. In[code]timed[/code] mode, the mean and standard deviation response timesfor a cached domain are calculated by sampling the resolution of a name(www.google.com) several times. Then, each domain is resolved and thetime taken compared to the mean. If it is less than one standarddeviation over the mean, it is considered cached. The [code]timed[/code]mode inserts entries in the cache and can only be used reliably once.The default list of domains to check consists of the top 50 most popularsites, each site being listed twice, once with "www." and once without.Use the [code]dns-cache-snoop.domains[/code] script argument to use adifferent list. |

First, it uses a HEAD request, then a POST request and finally a random generated string( This last one is useful when web servers treat unknown request methods as a GET request. This is the case for PHP servers ).If the table [code]paths[/code] is set, it will attempt to access the given URIs. Otherwise, a web crawleris initiated to try to find protected resources. Note that in a PHP environment with .htaccess files you need to specify apath to a file rather than a directory to find misconfigured .htaccess files.References: This web server contains password protected resources vulnerable to authentication bypassvulnerabilities via HTTP verb tampering. This is often found in web servers that only limit access to the common HTTP methods and in misconfigured .htaccess files.        |

The script can also detect outdated plugins by comparing version numbers with information pulled from api.wordpress.org.The script works with two separate databases for themes (wp-themes.lst) and plugins (wp-plugins.lst).The databases are sorted by popularity and the script will search only the top 100 entries by default.The theme database has around 32,000 entries while the plugin database has around 14,000 entries.The script determines the version number of a plugin by looking at the readme.txt file inside the plugindirectory and it uses the file style.css inside a theme directory to determine the theme version.If the script argument check-latest is set to true, the script will query api.wordpress.org to obtainthe latest version number available. This check is disabled by default since it queries an external service.This script is a combination of http-wordpress-plugins.nse and http-wordpress-themes.nse originallysubmited by Ange Gutek and Peter Hill.TODO:-Implement version checking for themes. |

Subsequent connections with the sameclient name may then use the same PIN without user interaction.

The default multicastgroup address is 0.0.0.0 and the default destination is our own host address. Asource address must be provided.

In both cases probe data is sent only to the UDPport because it allows for a simple and informative ping command.The single probe will report on the server version, current usercount, maximum users allowed on the server, and bandwidth used forvoice communication. It is used by the Mumble client to ping knownMurmur servers.The IP address from which service detection is being ran will mostlikely be temporarily banned by the target Murmur server due tomultiple incorrect handshakes (Nmap service probes). This ban makesidentifying the service via TCP impossible in practice, but does notaffect the UDP probe used by this script.It is possible to get a corrupt user count (usually  |

Both arepart of Remote Desktop Services.The script works by checking for the CVE-2012-0152 vulnerability. If thisvulnerability is not patched, it is assumed that CVE-2012-0002 is not patchedeither. This script can do its check without crashing the target.The way this works follows:  Send one user request. The server replies with a user id (call it A) and a channel for that user.  Send another user request. The server replies with another user id (call it B) and another channel.  Send a channel join request with requesting user set to A and requesting channel set to B. If the server replies with a success message, we conclude that the server is vulnerable.  In case the server is vulnerable, send a channel join request with the requesting user set to B and requesting channel set to B to prevent the chance of a crash.References:  http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-020  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2621440  http://zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-044/     Remote Desktop Protocol vulnerability that could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service.

The packet is sent      to both ends of the connection. Session Keys are derived using a      zero length pre master secret key, and future session keys also      share this weakness.    o Renegotiate the handshake parameters.    o The attacker is now able to decrypt or even modify the packets      in transit.description OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1hdoes not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages,which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zerolength master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, andconsequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, viaa crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.     |

Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use anonymousDiffie-Hellman key exchange only provide protection against passiveeavesdropping, and are vulnerable to active man-in-the-middle attackswhich could completely compromise the confidentiality and integrity The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol contains a flaw that istriggered when handling Diffie-Hellman key exchanges defined with Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use Diffie-Hellman groupsof insufficient strength, especially those using one of a few commonly This TLS service appears to be using a modulus that is not a safe primeand does not correspond to any well-known DSA group for Diffie-Hellmankey exchange.These parameters MAY be secure if:- They were generated according to the procedure described in  FIPS 186-4 for DSA Domain Parameter Generation, or- The generator g generates a subgroup of large prime orderAdditional testing may be required to verify the security of theseparameters. |

Still all the requests contain just two fields - thesoftware name and its version (or CPE), so one can still have the desired privacy. |
