## asn-query.nse

* 📝 [Source](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/asn-query.nse).
* 📂 discovery/external/safe .

```
  Maps IP addresses to autonomous system (AS) numbers.  The script works by sending DNS TXT queries to a DNS server which in turn queries a third-party service provided by Team Cymru (https://www.team-cymru.org/Services/ip-to-asn.html) using an in-addr.arpa style zone set up especially for use by Nmap. The responses to these queries contain both Origin and Peer ASNs and their descriptions, displayed along with the BGP Prefix and Country Code. The script caches results to reduce the number of queries and should perform a single query for all scanned targets in a BGP Prefix present in Team Cymru's database.  Be aware that any targets against which this script is run will be sent to and potentially recorded by one or more DNS servers and Team Cymru. In addition your IP address will be sent along with the ASN to a DNS server (your default DNS server, or whichever one you specified with the <code>dns</code> script argument). .

```

## broadcast-eigrp-discovery.nse

* 📝 [Source](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/broadcast-eigrp-discovery.nse).
* 📂 discovery/broadcast/safe .

```
  Performs network discovery and routing information gathering through Cisco's Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).  The script works by sending an EIGRP Hello packet with the specified Autonomous System value to the 224.0.0.10 multicast address and listening for EIGRP Update packets. The script then parses the update responses for routing information.  If no A.S value was provided by the user, the script will listen for multicast Hello packets to grab an A.S value. If no interface was provided as a script argument or through the -e option, the script will send packets and listen through all valid ethernet interfaces simultaneously.  .

* 📝 [Source](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/broadcast-igmp-discovery.nse).
* 📂 discovery/safe/broadcast .

```
  Discovers targets that have IGMP Multicast memberships and grabs interesting information.  The scripts works by sending IGMP Membership Query message to the 224.0.0.1 All Hosts multicast address and listening for IGMP Membership Report messages. The script then extracts all the interesting information from the report messages such as the version, group, mode, source addresses (depending on the version).  The script defaults to sending an IGMPv2 Query but this could be changed to another version (version 1 or 3) or to sending queries of all three version. If no interface was specified as a script argument or with the -e option, the script will proceed to sending queries through all the valid ethernet interfaces. .

## broadcast-ms-sql-discover.nse

* 📝 [Source](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/broadcast-ms-sql-discover.nse).
* 📂 broadcast/safe .

```
  Discovers Microsoft SQL servers in the same broadcast domain.  SQL Server credentials required: No (will not benefit from <code>mssql.username</code> & <code>mssql.password</code>).  The script attempts to discover SQL Server instances in the same broadcast domain. Any instances found are stored in the Nmap registry for use by any other ms-sql-* scripts that are run in the same scan.  In contrast to the <code>ms-sql-discover</code> script, the broadcast version will use a broadcast method rather than targeting individual hosts. However, the broadcast version will only use the SQL Server Browser service discovery method. .

## broadcast-ping.nse

* 📝 [Source](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/broadcast-ping.nse).
* 📂 discovery/safe/broadcast .

```
  Sends broadcast pings on a selected interface using raw ethernet packets and outputs the responding hosts' IP and MAC addresses or (if requested) adds them as targets.  Root privileges on UNIX are required to run this script since it uses raw sockets.  Most operating systems don't respond to broadcast-ping probes, but they can be configured to do so.  The interface on which is broadcasted can be specified using the -e Nmap option or the <code>broadcast-ping.interface</code> script-arg. If no interface is specified this script broadcasts on all ethernet interfaces which have an IPv4 address defined.  The <code>newtarget</code> script-arg can be used so the script adds the discovered IPs as targets.  The timeout of the ICMP probes can be specified using the <code>timeout</code> script-arg. The default timeout is 3000 ms. A higher number might be necessary when scanning across larger networks.  The number of sent probes can be specified using the <code>num-probes</code> script-arg. The default number is 1. A higher value might get more results on larger networks.  The ICMP probes sent comply with the --ttl and --data-length Nmap options, so you can use those to control the TTL(time to live) and ICMP payload length respectively. The default value for TTL is 64, and the length of the payload is 0. The payload is consisted of random bytes. .

  CICS transaction ID enumerator for IBM mainframes. This script is based on mainframe_brute by Dominic White (https://github.com/sensepost/mainframe_brute). However, this script doesn't rely on any third party libraries or tools and instead uses the NSE TN3270 library which emulates a TN3270 screen in lua.  CICS only allows for 4 byte transaction IDs, that is the only specific rule found for CICS transaction IDs. .

## dhcp-discover.nse

* 📂 discovery/safe .

```
  Sends a DHCPINFORM request to a host on UDP port 67 to obtain all the local configuration parameters without allocating a new address.  DHCPINFORM is a DHCP request that returns useful information from a DHCP server, without allocating an IP address. The request sends a list of which fields it wants to know (a handful by default, every field if verbosity is turned on), and the server responds with the fields that were requested. It should be noted that the server doesn't have to return every field, nor does it have to return them in the same order, or honour the request at all. A Linksys WRT54g, for example, completely ignores the list of requested fields and returns a few standard ones. This script displays every field it receives.  With script arguments, the type of DHCP request can be changed, which can lead to interesting results. Additionally, the MAC address can be randomized, which in should override the cache on the DHCP server and assign a new IP address. Extra requests can also be sent to exhaust the IP address range more quickly.  Some of the more useful fields: * DHCP Server (the address of the server that responded) * Subnet Mask * Router * DNS Servers * Hostname .

## dns-cache-snoop.nse

* 📝 [Source](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/dns-cache-snoop.nse).

  Performs DNS cache snooping against a DNS server.  There are two modes of operation, controlled by the <code>dns-cache-snoop.mode</code> script argument. In <code>nonrecursive</code> mode (the default), queries are sent to the server with the RD (recursion desired) flag set to 0. The server should respond positively to these only if it has the domain cached. In <code>timed</code> mode, the mean and standard deviation response times for a cached domain are calculated by sampling the resolution of a name (www.google.com) several times. Then, each domain is resolved and the time taken compared to the mean. If it is less than one standard deviation over the mean, it is considered cached. The <code>timed</code> mode inserts entries in the cache and can only be used reliably once.  The default list of domains to check consists of the top 50 most popular sites, each site being listed twice, once with ".

  Prints the readable strings from service fingerprints of unknown services.  Nmap's service and application version detection engine sends named probes to target services and tries to identify them based on the response. When there is no match, Nmap produces a service fingerprint for submission. Sometimes, inspecting this fingerprint can give clues as to the identity of the service. However, the fingerprint is encoded and wrapped to ensure it doesn't lose data, which can make it hard to read.  This script simply unwraps the fingerprint and prints the readable ASCII strings it finds below the name of the probe it responded to. The probe names are taken from the nmap-service-probes file, not from the response. .

## firewalk.nse

```
  Tries to discover firewall rules using an IP TTL expiration technique known as firewalking.  To determine a rule on a given gateway, the scanner sends a probe to a metric located behind the gateway, with a TTL one higher than the gateway. If the probe is forwarded by the gateway, then we can expect to receive an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED reply from the gateway next hop router, or eventually the metric itself if it is directly connected to the gateway. Otherwise, the probe will timeout.  It starts with a TTL equals to the distance to the target. If the probe timeout, then it is resent with a TTL decreased by one. If we get an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED, then the scan is over for this probe.  Every ".

## firewall-bypass.nse

* 📝 [Source](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/firewall-bypass.nse).
* 📂 vuln/intrusive .

```
  Detects a vulnerability in netfilter and other firewalls that use helpers to dynamically open ports for protocols such as ftp and sip.  The script works by spoofing a packet from the target server asking for opening a related connection to a target port which will be fulfilled by the firewall through the adequate protocol helper port. The attacking machine should be on the same network segment as the firewall for this to work. The script supports ftp helper on both IPv4 and IPv6. Real path filter is used to prevent such attacks.  Based on work done by Eric Leblond.  For more information, see:  * http://home.regit.org/2012/03/playing-with-network-layers-to-bypass-firewalls-filtering-policy/ .

* 📂 intrusive/exploit/vuln .

```
  This script detects Cross Site Request Forgeries (CSRF) vulnerabilities.  It will try to detect them by checking each form if it contains an unpredictable token for each user. Without one an attacker may forge malicious requests.  To recognize a token in a form, the script will iterate through the form's attributes and will search for common patterns in their names. If that fails, it will also calculate the entropy of each attribute's value. A big entropy means a possible token.  A common use case for this script comes along with a cookie that gives access in pages that require authentication, because that's where the privileged exist.

  Tests for access with default credentials used by a variety of web applications and devices.  It works similar to http-enum, we detect applications by matching known paths and launching a login routine using default credentials when found. This script depends on a fingerprint file containing the target's information: name, category, location paths, default credentials and login routine.  You may select a category if you wish to reduce the number of requests. We have categories like: * <code>web</code> - Web applications * <code>routers</code> - Routers * <code>security</code> - CCTVs and other security devices * <code>industrial</code> - Industrial systems * <code>printer</code> - Network-attached printers and printer servers * <code>storage</code> - Storage devices * <code>virtualization</code> - Virtualization systems * <code>console</code> - Remote consoles  You can also select a specific fingerprint or a brand, such as BIG-IQ or Siemens. This matching is based on case-insensitive words. This means that ".

   Tries to find out the technology behind the target website.  The script checks for certain defaults that might not have been changed, like common headers or URLs or HTML content.  While the script does some guessing, note that overall there's no way to determine what technologies a given site is using.  You can help improve this script by adding new entries to nselib/data/http-devframework-fingerprints.lua  Each entry must have: * <code>rapidDetect</code> - Callback function that is called in the beginning of detection process. It takes the host and port of target website as arguments. * <code>consumingDetect</code> - Callback function that is called for each spidered page. It takes the body of the response (HTML code) and the requested path as arguments.  Note that the <code>consumingDetect</code> callback will not take place only if <code>rapid</code> option is enabled.  .

```
  Enumerates directories used by popular web applications and servers.  This parses a fingerprint file that's similar in format to the Nikto Web application scanner. This script, however, takes it one step further by building in advanced pattern matching as well as having the ability to identify specific versions of Web applications.  You can also parse a Nikto-formatted database using http-fingerprints.nikto-db-path. This will try to parse most of the fingerprints defined in nikto's database in real time. More documentation about this in the nselib/data/http-fingerprints.lua file.  Currently, the database can be found under Nmap's directory in the nselib/data folder. The file is called http-fingerprints and has a long description of its functionality in the file header.  Many of the finger prints were discovered by me (Ron Bowes), and a number of them are from the Yokoso project, used with permission from Kevin Johnson (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0685.html).  Initially, this script attempts to access two different random files in order to detect servers that don't return a proper 404 Not Found status. In the event that they return 200 OK, the body has any non-static-looking data removed (URI, time, etc), and saved. If the two random attempts return different results, the script aborts (since a 200-looking 404 cannot be distinguished from an actual 200). This will prevent most false positives.  In addition, if the root folder returns a 301 Moved Permanently or 401 Authentication Required, this script will also abort. If the root folder has disappeared or requires authentication, there is little hope of finding anything inside it.  By default, only pages that return 200 OK or 401 Authentication Required are displayed. If the <code>http-enum.displayall</code> script argument is set, however, then all results will be displayed (except for 404 Not Found and the status code returned by the random files). Entries in the http-fingerprints database can specify their own criteria for accepting a page as valid.  .

* 📂 intrusive/brute .

```
  Performs brute force password auditing against http form-based authentication.  This script uses the unpwdb and brute libraries to perform password guessing. Any successful guesses are stored in the nmap registry, using the creds library, for other scripts to use.  The script automatically attempts to discover the form method, action, and field names to use in order to perform password guessing. (Use argument path to specify the page where the form resides.) If it fails doing so the form components can be supplied using arguments method, path, uservar, and passvar. The same arguments can be used to selectively override the detection outcome.  The script contains a small database of known web apps' form information. This improves form detection and also allows for form mangling and custom success detection functions. If the script arguments aren't expressive enough, users are encouraged to edit the database to fit.  After attempting to authenticate using a HTTP GET or POST request the script analyzes the response and attempts to determine whether authentication was successful or not. The script analyzes this by checking the response using the following rules:  1. If the response was empty the authentication was successful. 2. If the onsuccess argument was provided then the authentication either    succeeded or failed depending on whether the response body contained    the message/pattern passed in the onsuccess argument. 3. If no onsuccess argument was passed, and if the onfailure argument    was provided then the authentication either succeeded or failed    depending on whether the response body does not contain    the message/pattern passed in the onfailure argument. 4. If neither the onsuccess nor onfailure argument was passed and the    response contains a form field named the same as the submitted    password parameter then the authentication failed. 5. Authentication was successful. .

  Attempts to bypass password protected resources (HTTP 401 status) by performing HTTP verb tampering. If an array of paths to check is not set, it will crawl the web server and perform the check against any password protected resource that it finds.  The script determines if the protected URI is vulnerable by performing HTTP verb tampering and monitoring  the status codes. First, it uses a HEAD request, then a POST request and finally a random generated string ( This last one is useful when web servers treat unknown request methods as a GET request. This is the case  for PHP servers ).  If the table <code>paths</code> is set, it will attempt to access the given URIs. Otherwise, a web crawler is initiated to try to find protected resources. Note that in a PHP environment with .htaccess files you need to specify a path to a file rather than a directory to find misconfigured .htaccess files.

  Tests a web server for vulnerability to the Slowloris DoS attack without actually launching a DoS attack.  Slowloris was described at Defcon 17 by RSnake (see http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/).  This script opens two connections to the server, each without the final CRLF. After 10 seconds, second connection sends additional header. Both connections then wait for server timeout.  If second connection gets a timeout 10 or more seconds after the first one, we can conclude that sending additional header prolonged its timeout and that the server is vulnerable to slowloris DoS attack.  A "
  Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service. .

  Tests a web server for vulnerability to the Slowloris DoS attack by launching a Slowloris attack.  Slowloris was described at Defcon 17 by RSnake (see http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/).  This script opens and maintains numerous 'half-HTTP' connections until the server runs out of resources, leading to a denial of service. When a successful DoS is detected, the script stops the attack and returns these pieces of information (which may be useful to tweak further filtering rules): * Time taken until DoS * Number of sockets used * Number of queries sent By default the script runs for 30 minutes if DoS is not achieved.  Please note that the number of concurrent connexions must be defined with the <code>--max-parallelism</code> option (default is 20, suggested is 400 or more) Also, be advised that in some cases this attack can bring the web server down for good, not only while the attack is running.  Also, due to OS limitations, the script is unlikely to work when run from Windows. .

The errors are analysed to see if the URL is vulnerable to attack. This uses the most basic form of SQL injection but anything more complicated is better suited to a standalone tool.  We may not have access to the target web server's true hostname, which can prevent access to virtually hosted sites. .

The script injects new Drupal administrator user via login form and then it attempts to log in as this user to determine if target is vulnerable. If that's the case following exploitation steps are performed:  * PHP filter module which allows embedded PHP code/snippets to be evaluated is enabled, * permission to use PHP code for administrator users is set, * new article which contains payload is created & previewed, * cleanup: by default all DB records that were added/modified by the script are restored.  Vulnerability originally discovered by Stefan Horst from SektionEins.  Exploitation technique used to achieve RCE on the target is based on exploit/multi/http/drupal_drupageddon Metasploit module. 
    The expandArguments function in the database abstraction API in   Drupal core 7.x before 7.32 does not properly construct prepared   statements, which allows remote attackers to conduct SQL injection   attacks via an array containing crafted keys.     .

  Enumerates themes and plugins of Wordpress installations. The script can also detect  outdated plugins by comparing version numbers with information pulled from api.wordpress.org.  The script works with two separate databases for themes (wp-themes.lst) and plugins (wp-plugins.lst). The databases are sorted by popularity and the script will search only the top 100 entries by default. The theme database has around 32,000 entries while the plugin database has around 14,000 entries.  The script determines the version number of a plugin by looking at the readme.txt file inside the plugin directory and it uses the file style.css inside a theme directory to determine the theme version. If the script argument check-latest is set to true, the script will query api.wordpress.org to obtain the latest version number available. This check is disabled by default since it queries an external service.  This script is a combination of http-wordpress-plugins.nse and http-wordpress-themes.nse originally submited by Ange Gutek and Peter Hill.  TODO: -Implement version checking for themes. .

  Attempts to brute-force LDAP authentication. By default it uses the built-in username and password lists. In order to use your own lists use the <code>userdb</code> and <code>passdb</code> script arguments.  This script does not make any attempt to prevent account lockout! If the number of passwords in the dictionary exceed the amount of allowed tries, accounts will be locked out. This usually happens very quickly.  Authenticating against Active Directory using LDAP does not use the Windows user name but the user accounts distinguished name. LDAP on Windows 2003 allows authentication using a simple user name rather than using the fully distinguished name. E.g., ".

  Performs password guessing against Microsoft SQL Server (ms-sql). Works best in conjunction with the <code>broadcast-ms-sql-discover</code> script.  SQL Server credentials required: No  (will not benefit from <code>mssql.username</code> & <code>mssql.password</code>).  Run criteria: * Host script: Will run if the <code>mssql.instance-all</code>, <code>mssql.instance-name</code> or <code>mssql.instance-port</code> script arguments are used (see mssql.lua). * Port script: Will run against any services identified as SQL Servers, but only if the <code>mssql.instance-all</code>, <code>mssql.instance-name</code> and <code>mssql.instance-port</code> script arguments are NOT used.  WARNING: SQL Server 2005 and later versions include support for account lockout policies (which are enforced on a per-user basis). If an account is locked out, the script will stop running for that instance, unless the <code>ms-sql-brute.ignore-lockout</code> argument is used.  NOTE: Communication with instances via named pipes depends on the <code>smb</code> library. To communicate with (and possibly to discover) instances via named pipes, the host must have at least one SMB port (e.g. TCP 445) that was scanned and found to be open. Additionally, named pipe connections may require Windows authentication to connect to the Windows host (via SMB) in addition to the authentication required to connect to the SQL Server instances itself. See the documentation and arguments for the <code>smb</code> library for more information.  NOTE: By default, the ms-sql-* scripts may attempt to connect to and communicate with ports that were not included in the port list for the Nmap scan. This can be disabled using the <code>mssql.scanned-ports-only</code> script argument. .

  Queries the Microsoft SQL Browser service for the DAC (Dedicated Admin Connection) port of a given (or all) SQL Server instance. The DAC port is used to connect to the database instance when normal connection attempts fail, for example, when server is hanging, out of memory or in other bad states. In addition, the DAC port provides an admin with access to system objects otherwise not accessible over normal connections.  The DAC feature is accessible on the loopback adapter per default, but can be activated for remote access by setting the 'remote admin connection' configuration value to 1. In some cases, when DAC has been remotely enabled but later disabled, the sql browser service may incorrectly report it as available. The script therefore attempts to connect to the reported port in order to verify whether it's accessible or not. .

Run criteria: * Host script: Will always run. * Port script: N/A  NOTE: Unlike previous versions, this script will NOT attempt to log in to SQL Server instances. Blank passwords can be checked using the <code>ms-sql-empty-password</code> script. E.g.: <code>nmap -sn --script ms-sql-empty-password --script-args mssql.instance-all <host></code>  The script uses two means of getting version information for SQL Server instances: * Querying the SQL Server Browser service, which runs by default on UDP port 1434 on servers that have SQL Server 2000 or later installed. However, this service may be disabled without affecting the functionality of the instances. Additionally, it provides imprecise version information. * Sending a probe to the instance, causing the instance to respond with information including the exact version number. This is the same method that Nmap uses for service versioning; however, this script can also do the same for instances accessible via Windows named pipes, and can target all of the instances listed by the SQL Server Browser service.  In the event that the script can connect to the SQL Server Browser service (UDP 1434) but is unable to connect directly to the instance to obtain more accurate version information (because ports are blocked or the <code>mssql.scanned-ports-only</code> argument has been used), the script will rely only upon the version number provided by the SQL Server Browser/Monitor, which has the following limitations: * For SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 7.0 instances, the RTM version number is always given, regardless of any service packs or patches installed. * For SQL Server 2005 and later, the version number will reflect the service pack installed, but the script will not be able to tell whether patches have been installed.  Where possible, the script will determine major version numbers, service pack levels and whether patches have been installed. However, in cases where particular determinations can not be made, the script will report only what can be confirmed.  NOTE: Communication with instances via named pipes depends on the <code>smb</code> library. To communicate with (and possibly to discover) instances via named pipes, the host must have at least one SMB port (e.g. TCP 445) that was scanned and found to be open.

NOTE: Communication with instances via named pipes depends on the <code>smb</code> library. To communicate with (and possibly to discover) instances via named pipes, the host must have at least one SMB port (e.g. TCP 445) that was scanned and found to be open. Additionally, named pipe connections may require Windows authentication to connect to the Windows host (via SMB) in addition to the authentication required to connect to the SQL Server instances itself. See the documentation and arguments for the <code>smb</code> library for more information.  NOTE: By default, the ms-sql-* scripts may attempt to connect to and communicate with ports that were not included in the port list for the Nmap scan. This can be disabled using the <code>mssql.scanned-ports-only</code> script argument. .

  Queries for the multicast path from a source to a destination host.  This works by sending an IGMP Traceroute Query and listening for IGMP Traceroute responses. The Traceroute Query is sent to the first hop and contains information about source, destination and multicast group addresses. First hop defaults to the multicast All routers address. The default multicast group address is 0.0.0.0 and the default destination is our own host address. A source address must be provided. The responses are parsed to get interesting information about interface addresses, used protocols and error codes.  This is similar to the mtrace utility provided in Cisco IOS. .

* 📂 version .

```
  Detects the Murmur service (server for the Mumble voice communication client) versions 1.2.X.  The Murmur server listens on a TCP (control) and a UDP (voice) port with the same port number. This script activates on both a TCP and UDP port version scan. In both cases probe data is sent only to the UDP port because it allows for a simple and informative ping command.  The single probe will report on the server version, current user count, maximum users allowed on the server, and bandwidth used for voice communication. It is used by the Mumble client to ping known Murmur servers.  The IP address from which service detection is being ran will most likely be temporarily banned by the target Murmur server due to multiple incorrect handshakes (Nmap service probes). This ban makes identifying the service via TCP impossible in practice, but does not affect the UDP probe used by this script.  It is possible to get a corrupt user count (usually +1) when doing a TCP service scan due to previous service probe connections affecting the server.  See http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Protocol. .

   Attempts to bypass authentication in MySQL and MariaDB servers by exploiting CVE2012-2122. If its vulnerable, it will also attempt to dump the MySQL usernames and password hashes.  All MariaDB and MySQL versions up to 5.1.61, 5.2.11, 5.3.5, 5.5.22 are vulnerable but exploitation depends on whether memcmp() returns an arbitrary integer outside of -128..127 range.  "
  When a user connects to MariaDB/MySQL, a token (SHA over a password and a random scramble string) is calculated and compared with the expected value. Because of incorrect casting, it might've happened that the token and the expected value were considered equal, even if the memcmp() returned a non-zero value. In this case MySQL/MariaDB would think that the password is correct, even while it is not.  Because the protocol uses random strings, the probability of hitting this bug is about 1/256. Which means, if one knows a user name to connect (and ".

To initiate NJE the client sends a 33 byte record containing the type of record, the hostname (RHOST), IP address (RIP), target (OHOST), target IP (OIP) and a 1 byte response value (R) as outlined below:  <code> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |  TYPE       |     RHOST     | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |  RIP  |  OHOST      | OIP   | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | R | +-+-+ </code>  * TYPE: Can either be 'OPEN', 'ACK', or 'NAK', in EBCDIC, padded by spaces to make 8 bytes. This script always send 'OPEN' type. * RHOST: Node name of the local machine initiating the connection. Set to 'FAKE'. * RIP: Hex value of the local systems IP address. Set to '0.0.0.0' * OHOST: The value being enumerated to determine the targets NJE node name. * OIP: IP address, in hex, of the target system. Set to '0.0.0.0'. * R: The response. NJE will send an 'R' of 0x01 if the OHOST is wrong or 0x04 if the OHOST is correct.  By default this script will attempt the brute force a mainframes OHOST. If supplied with the argument <code>nje-node-brute.ohost</code> this script will attempt the bruteforce the RHOST, setting OHOST to the value supplied to the argument.  Since most systems will only have one OHOST name, it is recommended to use the <code>brute.firstonly</code> script argument. .

```
  Obtains and prints an NTP server's monitor data.  Monitor data is a list of the most recently used (MRU) having NTP associations with the target. Each record contains information about the most recent NTP packet sent by a host to the target including the source and destination addresses and the NTP version and mode of the packet. With this information it is possible to classify associated hosts as Servers, Peers, and Clients.  A Peers command is also sent to the target and the peers list in the response allows differentiation between configured Mode 1 Peers and clients which act like Peers (such as the Windows W32Time service).  Associated hosts are further classified as either public or private. Private hosts are those having IP addresses which are not routable on the public Internet and thus can help to form a picture about the topology of the private network on which the target resides.  Other information revealed by the monlist and peers commands are the host with which the target clock is synchronized and hosts which send Control Mode (6) and Private Mode (7) commands to the target and which may be used by admins for the NTP service.  It should be noted that the very nature of the NTP monitor data means that the Mode 7 commands sent by this script are recorded by the target (and will often appear in these results). Since the monitor data is a MRU list, it is probable that you can overwrite the record of the Mode 7 command by sending an innocuous looking Client Mode request. This can be achieved easily using Nmap: <code>nmap -sU -pU:123 -Pn -n --max-retries.

  Performs brute force password auditing against Oracle servers.  Running it in default mode it performs an audit against a list of common Oracle usernames and passwords. The mode can be changed by supplying the argument oracle-brute.nodefault at which point the script will use the username- and password- lists supplied with Nmap. Custom username- and password- lists may be supplied using the userdb and passdb arguments. The default credential list can be changed too by using the brute.credfile argument. In case the userdb or passdb arguments are supplied, the script assumes that it should run in the nodefault mode.  In modern versions of Oracle password guessing speeds decrease after a few guesses and remain slow, due to connection throttling.  WARNING: The script makes no attempt to discover the amount of guesses that can be made before locking an account. Running this script may therefor result in a large number of accounts being locked out on the database server. .

  Checks if a host is infected with Conficker.C or higher, based on Conficker's peer to peer communication.  When Conficker.C or higher infects a system, it opens four ports: two TCP and two UDP. The ports are random, but are seeded with the current week and the IP of the infected host. By determining the algorithm, one can check if these four ports are open, and can probe them for more data.  Once the open ports are found, communication can be initiated using Conficker's custom peer to peer protocol.  If a valid response is received, then a valid Conficker infection has been found.  This check won't work properly on a multihomed or NATed system because the open ports will be based on a nonpublic IP.  The argument <code>checkall</code> tells Nmap to attempt communication with every open port (much like a version check) and the argument <code>realip</code> tells Nmap to base its port generation on the given IP address instead of the actual IP.  By default, this will run against a system that has a standard Windows port open (445, 139, 137). The arguments <code>checkall</code> and <code>checkconficker</code> will both perform checks regardless of which port is open, see the args section for more information.  Note: Ensure your clock is correct (within a week) before using this script!  The majority of research for this script was done by Symantec Security Response, and some was taken from public sources (most notably the port blacklisting was found by David Fifield). A big thanks goes out to everybody who contributed! .

  Performs simple Path MTU Discovery to target hosts.  TCP or UDP packets are sent to the host with the DF (don't fragment) bit set and with varying amounts of data.  If an ICMP Fragmentation Needed is received, or no reply is received after retransmissions, the amount of data is lowered and another packet is sent.  This continues until (assuming no errors occur) a reply from the final host is received, indicating the packet reached the host without being fragmented.  Not all MTUs are attempted so as to not expend too much time or network resources.  Currently the relatively short list of MTUs to try contains the plateau values from Table 7-1 in RFC 1191, ".

  Checks if a machine is vulnerable to MS12-020 RDP vulnerability.  The Microsoft bulletin MS12-020 patches two vulnerabilities: CVE-2012-0152 which addresses a denial of service vulnerability inside Terminal Server, and CVE-2012-0002 which fixes a vulnerability in Remote Desktop Protocol. Both are part of Remote Desktop Services.  The script works by checking for the CVE-2012-0152 vulnerability. If this vulnerability is not patched, it is assumed that CVE-2012-0002 is not patched either. This script can do its check without crashing the target.  The way this works follows: * Send one user request. The server replies with a user id (call it A) and a channel for that user. * Send another user request. The server replies with another user id (call it B) and another channel. * Send a channel join request with requesting user set to A and requesting channel set to B. If the server replies with a success message, we conclude that the server is vulnerable. * In case the server is vulnerable, send a channel join request with the requesting user set to B and requesting channel set to B to prevent the chance of a crash.

```
  Attempts to guess username/password combinations over SMB, storing discovered combinations for use in other scripts. Every attempt will be made to get a valid list of users and to verify each username before actually using them. When a username is discovered, besides being printed, it is also saved in the Nmap registry so other Nmap scripts can use it. That means that if you're going to run <code>smb-brute.nse</code>, you should run other <code>smb</code> scripts you want. This checks passwords in a case-insensitive way, determining case after a password is found, for Windows versions before Vista.  This script is specifically targeted towards security auditors or penetration testers. One example of its use, suggested by Brandon Enright, was hooking up <code>smb-brute.nse</code> to the database of usernames and passwords used by the Conficker worm (the password list can be found at http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords, among other places. Then, the network is scanned and all systems that would be infected by Conficker are discovered.  From the penetration tester perspective its use is pretty obvious. By discovering weak passwords on SMB, a protocol that's well suited for bruteforcing, access to a system can be gained. Further, passwords discovered against Windows with SMB might also be used on Linux or MySQL or custom Web applications. Discovering a password greatly beneficial for a pen-tester.  This script uses a lot of little tricks that I (Ron Bowes) describe in detail in a blog posting, http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/?p.

Since this requires administrator privileges, it isn't especially useful for a penetration tester, since they can effectively do the same thing with metasploit or other tools. It does, however, provide for a quick way to get process lists for a bunch of systems at the same time.

  Attempts to list shares using the <code>srvsvc.NetShareEnumAll</code> MSRPC function and retrieve more information about them using <code>srvsvc.NetShareGetInfo</code>. If access to those functions is denied, a list of common share names are checked.  Finding open shares is useful to a penetration tester because there may be private files shared, or, if it's writable, it could be a good place to drop a Trojan or to infect a file that's already there. Knowing where the share is could make those kinds of tests more useful, except that determining where the share is requires administrative privileges already.  Running <code>NetShareEnumAll</code> will work anonymously against Windows 2000, and requires a user-level account on any other Windows version. Calling <code>NetShareGetInfo</code> requires an administrator account on all versions of Windows up to 2003, as well as Windows Vista and Windows 7, if UAC is turned down.  Even if <code>NetShareEnumAll</code> is restricted, attempting to connect to a share will always reveal its existence. So, if <code>NetShareEnumAll</code> fails, a pre-generated list of shares, based on a large test network, are used. If any of those succeed, they are recorded.  After a list of shares is found, the script attempts to connect to each of them anonymously, which divides them into ".

```
  Attempts to enumerate the users on a remote Windows system, with as much information as possible, through two different techniques (both over MSRPC, which uses port 445 or 139; see <code>smb.lua</code>). The goal of this script is to discover all user accounts that exist on a remote system. This can be helpful for administration, by seeing who has an account on a server, or for penetration testing or network footprinting, by determining which accounts exist on a system.  A penetration tester who is examining servers may wish to determine the purpose of a server. By getting a list of who has access to it, the tester might get a better idea (if financial people have accounts, it probably relates to financial information). Additionally, knowing which accounts exist on a system (or on multiple systems) allows the pen-tester to build a dictionary of possible usernames for bruteforces, such as a SMB bruteforce or a Telnet bruteforce. These accounts may be helpful for other purposes, such as using the accounts in Web applications on this or other servers.  From a pen-testers perspective, retrieving the list of users on any given server creates endless possibilities.  Users are enumerated in two different ways:  using SAMR enumeration or LSA bruteforcing. By default, both are used, but they have specific advantages and disadvantages. Using both is a great default, but in certain circumstances it may be best to give preference to one.  Advantages of using SAMR enumeration: * Stealthier (requires one packet/user account, whereas LSA uses at least 10 packets while SAMR uses half that; additionally, LSA makes a lot of noise in the Windows event log (LSA enumeration is the only script I (Ron Bowes) have been called on by the administrator of a box I was testing against). * More information is returned (more than just the username). * Every account will be found, since they're being enumerated with a function that's designed to enumerate users.  Advantages of using LSA bruteforcing: * More accounts are returned (system accounts, groups, and aliases are returned, not just users). * Requires a lower-level account to run on Windows XP and higher (a 'guest' account can be used, whereas SAMR enumeration requires a 'user' account; especially useful when only guest access is allowed, or when an account has a blank password (which effectively gives it guest access)).  SAMR enumeration is done with the  <code>QueryDisplayInfo</code> function. If this succeeds, it will return a detailed list of users, along with descriptions, types, and full names. This can be done anonymously against Windows 2000, and with a user-level account on other Windows versions (but not with a guest-level account).  To perform this test, the following functions are used: * <code>Bind</code>: bind to the SAMR service. * <code>Connect4</code>: get a connect_handle. * <code>EnumDomains</code>: get a list of the domains. * <code>QueryDomain</code>: get the sid for the domain. * <code>OpenDomain</code>: get a handle for each domain. * <code>QueryDisplayInfo</code>: get the list of users in the domain. * <code>Close</code>: Close the domain handle. * <code>Close</code>: Close the connect handle. The advantage of this technique is that a lot of details are returned, including the full name and description; the disadvantage is that it requires a user-level account on every system except for Windows 2000. Additionally, it only pulls actual user accounts, not groups or aliases.  Regardless of whether this succeeds, a second technique is used to pull user accounts, called LSA bruteforcing. LSA bruteforcing can be done anonymously against Windows 2000, and requires a guest account or better on other systems. It has the advantage of running with less permission, and will also find more account types (i.e., groups, aliases, etc.). The disadvantages is that it returns less information, and that, because it's a brute-force guess, it's possible to miss accounts. It's also extremely noisy.  This isn't a brute-force technique in the common sense, however: it's a brute-forcing of users' RIDs. A user's RID is a value (generally 500, 501, or 1000+) that uniquely identifies a user on a domain or system. An LSA function is exposed which lets us convert the RID (say, 1000) to the username (say, ".

  Exhausts a remote SMB server's connection limit by by opening as many connections as we can.  Most implementations of SMB have a hard global limit of 11 connections for user accounts and 10 connections for anonymous. Once that limit is reached, further connections are denied. This script exploits that limit by taking up all the connections and holding them.  This works better with a valid user account, because Windows reserves one slot for valid users. So, no matter how many anonymous connections are taking up spaces, a single valid user can still log in.  This is *not* recommended as a general purpose script, because a) it is designed to harm the server and has no useful output, and b) it never ends (until timeout). .

  Attempts to determine the operating system, computer name, domain, workgroup, and current time over the SMB protocol (ports 445 or 139). This is done by starting a session with the anonymous account (or with a proper user account, if one is given; it likely doesn't make a difference); in response to a session starting, the server will send back all this information.  The following fields may be included in the output, depending on the circumstances (e.g. the workgroup name is mutually exclusive with domain and forest names) and the information available: * OS * Computer name * Domain name * Forest name * FQDN * NetBIOS computer name * NetBIOS domain name * Workgroup * System time  Some systems, like Samba, will blank out their name (and only send their domain). Other systems (like embedded printers) will simply leave out the information. Other systems will blank out various pieces (some will send back 0 for the current time, for example).  If this script is used in conjunction with version detection it can augment the standard nmap version detection information with data that this script has discovered.  Retrieving the name and operating system of a server is a vital step in targeting an attack against it, and this script makes that retrieval easy. Additionally, if a penetration tester is choosing between multiple targets, the time can help identify servers that are being poorly maintained (for more information/random thoughts on using the time, see http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/?p.

  Implements remote process execution similar to the Sysinternals' psexec tool, allowing a user to run a series of programs on a remote machine and read the output. This is great for gathering information about servers, running the same tool on a range of system, or even installing a backdoor on a collection of computers.  This script can run commands present on the remote machine, such as ping or tracert, or it can upload a program and run it, such as pwdump6 or a backdoor. Additionally, it can read the program's stdout/stderr and return it to the user (works well with ping, pwdump6, etc), or it can read a file that the process generated (fgdump, for example, generates a file), or it can just start the process and let it run headless (a backdoor might run like this).  To use this, a configuration file should be created and edited. Several configuration files are included that you can customize, or you can write your own. This config file is placed in <code>nselib/data/psexec</code> (if you aren't sure where that is, search your system for <code>default.lua</code>), then is passed to Nmap as a script argument (for example, myconfig.lua would be passed as <code>--script-args.

  Returns information about the SMB security level determined by SMB.  Here is how to interpret the output:  * User-level authentication: Each user has a separate username/password that   is used to log into the system. This is the default setup of pretty much   everything these days. * Share-level authentication: The anonymous account should be used to log   in, then the password is given (in plaintext) when a share is accessed.   All users who have access to the share use this password. This was the   original way of doing things, but isn't commonly seen, now. If a server   uses share-level security, it is vulnerable to sniffing. * Challenge/response passwords supported: If enabled, the server can accept   any type of password (plaintext, LM and NTLM, and LMv2 and NTLMv2).  If it   isn't set, the server can only accept plaintext passwords. Most servers   are configured to use challenge/response these days. If a server is   configured to accept plaintext passwords, it is vulnerable to sniffing. LM   and NTLM are fairly secure, although there are some brute-force attacks   against them.  Additionally, LM and NTLM can fall victim to   man-in-the-middle attacks or relay attacks (see MS08-068 or my writeup of   it: http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/?p.

Unpatched versions of Samba from 3.5.0 to 4.4.13, and versions prior to 4.5.10 and 4.6.4 are affected by a vulnerability that allows remote code execution, allowing a malicious client to upload a shared library to a writable share, and then cause the server to load and execute it.  The script does not scan the version numbers by default as the patches released for the mainstream Linux distributions do not change the version numbers.  The script checks the preconditions for the exploit to happen:  1)  If the argument check-version is applied, the script will ONLY check     services running potentially vulnerable versions of Samba, and run the     exploit against those services. This is useful if you wish to scan a     group of hosts quickly for the vulnerability based on the version number.     However, because of their version number, some patched versions may still     show up as likely vulnerable.

SMB2 protocol negotiation response returns the system boot time  pre-authentication. This information can be used to determine  if a system is missing critical patches without triggering IDS/IPS/AVs.  Remember that a rebooted system may still be vulnerable. This check only reveals unpatched systems based on the uptime, no additional probes are sent.  References: * https://twitter.com/breakersall/status/880496571581857793 .

  Attempts to enumerate the users on a SMTP server by issuing the VRFY, EXPN or RCPT TO commands. The goal of this script is to discover all the user accounts in the remote system.  The script will output the list of user names that were found. The script will stop querying the SMTP server if authentication is enforced. If an error occurs while testing the target host, the error will be printed with the list of any combinations that were found prior to the error.  The user can specify which methods to use and in which order. The script will ignore repeated methods. If not specified the script will use the RCPT first, then VRFY and EXPN. An example of how to specify the methods to use and the order is the following:  <code>smtp-enum-users.methods.

  Attempts to relay mail by issuing a predefined combination of SMTP commands. The goal of this script is to tell if a SMTP server is vulnerable to mail relaying.  An SMTP server that works as an open relay, is a email server that does not verify if the user is authorised to send email from the specified email address. Therefore, users would be able to send email originating from any third-party email address that they want.  The checks are done based in combinations of MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands. The list is hardcoded in the source file. The script will output all the working combinations that the server allows if nmap is in verbose mode otherwise the script will print the number of successful tests. The script will not output if the server requires authentication.  If debug is enabled and an error occurs while testing the target host, the error will be printed with the list of any combinations that were found prior to the error. .

  Checks for and/or exploits a heap overflow within versions of Exim prior to version 4.69 (CVE-2010-4344) and a privilege escalation vulnerability in Exim 4.72 and prior (CVE-2010-4345).  The heap overflow vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon (CVE-2010-4344). If the exploit fails then the Exim smtpd child will be killed (heap corruption).  The script also checks for a privilege escalation vulnerability that affects Exim version 4.72 and prior. The vulnerability allows the exim user to gain root privileges by specifying an alternate configuration file using the -C option (CVE-2010-4345).  The <code>smtp-vuln-cve2010-4344.exploit</code> script argument will make the script try to exploit the vulnerabilities, by sending more than 50MB of data, it depends on the message size limit configuration option of the Exim server.

  Attempts to find an SNMP community string by brute force guessing.  This script opens a sending socket and a sniffing pcap socket in parallel threads. The sending socket sends the SNMP probes with the community strings, while the pcap socket sniffs the network for an answer to the probes. If valid community strings are found, they are added to the creds database and reported in the output.  The script takes the <code>snmp-brute.communitiesdb</code> argument that allows the user to define the file that contains the community strings to be used. If not defined, the default wordlist used to bruteforce the SNMP community strings is <code>nselib/data/snmpcommunities.lst</code>.

  Weak ephemeral Diffie-Hellman parameter detection for SSL/TLS services.  This script simulates SSL/TLS handshakes using ciphersuites that have ephemeral Diffie-Hellman as the key exchange algorithm.  Diffie-Hellman MODP group parameters are extracted and analyzed for vulnerability to Logjam (CVE 2015-4000) and other weaknesses.  Opportunistic STARTTLS sessions are established on services that support them. 
  Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchange only provide protection against passive eavesdropping, and are vulnerable to active man-in-the-middle attacks which could completely compromise the confidentiality and integrity of any data exchanged over the resulting session.
  The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol contains a flaw that is triggered when handling Diffie-Hellman key exchanges defined with the DHE_EXPORT cipher. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to downgrade the security of a TLS session to 512-bit export-grade cryptography, which is significantly weaker, allowing the attacker to more easily break the encryption and monitor or tamper with the encrypted stream.
  Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use Diffie-Hellman groups of insufficient strength, especially those using one of a few commonly shared groups, may be susceptible to passive eavesdropping attacks.
  This TLS service appears to be using a modulus that is not a safe prime and does not correspond to any well-known DSA group for Diffie-Hellman key exchange. These parameters MAY be secure if: - They were generated according to the procedure described in   FIPS 186-4 for DSA Domain Parameter Generation, or - The generator g generates a subgroup of large prime order Additional testing may be required to verify the security of these parameters..

## ssl-enum-ciphers.nse

* 📂 discovery/intrusive .

```
  This script repeatedly initiates SSLv3/TLS connections, each time trying a new cipher or compressor while recording whether a host accepts or rejects it. The end result is a list of all the ciphersuites and compressors that a server accepts.  Each ciphersuite is shown with a letter grade (A through F) indicating the strength of the connection. The grade is based on the cryptographic strength of the key exchange and of the stream cipher. The message integrity (hash) algorithm choice is not a factor.  The output line beginning with <code>Least strength</code> shows the strength of the weakest cipher offered. The scoring is based on the Qualys SSL Labs SSL Server Rating Guide, but does not take protocol support (TLS version) into account, which makes up 30% of the SSL Labs rating.  SSLv3/TLSv1 requires more effort to determine which ciphers and compression methods a server supports than SSLv2. A client lists the ciphers and compressors that it is capable of supporting, and the server will respond with a single cipher and compressor chosen, or a rejection notice.  Some servers use the client's ciphersuite ordering: they choose the first of the client's offered suites that they also support. Other servers prefer their own ordering: they choose their most preferred suite from among those the client offers. In the case of server ordering, the script makes extra probes to discover the server's sorted preference list. Otherwise, the list is sorted alphabetically.  The script will warn about certain SSL misconfigurations such as MD5-signed certificates, low-quality ephemeral DH parameters, and the POODLE vulnerability.  This script is intrusive since it must initiate many connections to a server, and therefore is quite noisy.  It is recommended to use this script in conjunction with version detection (<code>-sV</code>) in order to discover SSL/TLS services running on unexpected ports. For the most common SSL ports like 443, 25 (with STARTTLS), 3389, etc. the script is smart enough to run on its own.

```
  Performs IPv6 host discovery by triggering stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC).  This script works by sending an ICMPv6 Router Advertisement with a random address prefix, which causes hosts to begin SLAAC and send a solicitation for their newly configured address, as part of duplicate address detection. The script then guesses the remote addresses by combining the link-local prefix of the interface with the interface identifier in each of the received solicitations. This should be followed up with ordinary ND host discovery to verify that the guessed addresses are correct.  The router advertisement has a router lifetime of zero and a short prefix lifetime (a few seconds)  See also: * RFC 4862, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, especially section 5.5.3. * https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/auxiliary/scanner/discovery/ipv6_neighbor_router_advertisement.rb .

## ventrilo-info.nse

```
  Detects the Ventrilo voice communication server service versions 2.1.2 and above and tries to determine version and configuration information. Some of the older versions (pre 3.0.0) may not have the UDP service that this probe relies on enabled by default.  The Ventrilo server listens on a TCP (voice/control) and an UDP (ping/status) port with the same port number (fixed to 3784 in the free version, otherwise configurable). This script activates on both a TCP and UDP port version scan. In both cases probe data is sent only to the UDP port because it allows for a simple and informative status command as implemented by the <code>ventrilo_status.exe</code> executable which has shipped alongside the Windows server package since version 2.1.2 when the UDP status service was implemented.  When run as a version detection script (<code>-sV</code>), the script will report on the server version, name, uptime, authentication scheme, and OS.  When run explicitly (<code>--script ventrilo-info</code>), the script will additionally report on the server name phonetic pronunciation string, the server comment, maximum number of clients, voice codec, voice format, channel and client counts, and details about channels and currently connected clients.  Original reversing of the protocol was done by Luigi Auriemma (http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm#ventrilo). .

## vulners.nse

```
  For each available CPE the script prints out known vulns (links to the correspondent info) and correspondent CVSS scores.  Its work is pretty simple: * work only when some software version is identified for an open port * take all the known CPEs for that software (from the standard nmap -sV output) * make a request to a remote server (vulners.com API) to learn whether any known vulns exist for that CPE * if no info is found this way, try to get it using the software name alone * print the obtained info out  NB: Since the size of the DB with all the vulns is more than 250GB there is no way to use a local db. So we do make requests to a remote service. Still all the requests contain just two fields - the software name and its version (or CPE), so one can still have the desired privacy. .

```
  Queries the WHOIS services of Regional Internet Registries (RIR) and attempts to retrieve information about the IP Address Assignment which contains the Target IP Address.  The fields displayed contain information about the assignment and the organisation responsible for managing the address space. When output verbosity is requested on the Nmap command line (<code>-v</code>) extra information about the assignment will be displayed.  To determine which of the RIRs to query for a given Target IP Address this script utilises Assignments Data hosted by IANA. The data is cached locally and then parsed for use as a lookup table.  The locally cached files are refreshed periodically to help ensure the data is current.  If, for any reason, these files are not available to the script then a default sequence of Whois services are queried in turn until: the desired record is found; or a referral to another (defined) Whois service is found; or until the sequence is exhausted without finding either a referral or the desired record.  The script will recognize a referral to another Whois service if that service is defined in the script and will continue by sending a query to the referred service.  A record is assumed to be the desired one if it does not contain a referral.  To reduce the number unnecessary queries sent to Whois services a record cache is employed and the entries in the cache can be applied to any targets within the range of addresses represented in the record.  In certain circumstances, the ability to cache responses prevents the discovery of other, smaller IP address assignments applicable to the target because a cached response is accepted in preference to sending a Whois query.  When it is important to ensure that the most accurate information about the IP address assignment is retrieved the script argument <code>whodb</code> should be used with a value of <code>".
