 Sends broadcast pings on a selected interface using raw ethernet packets andoutputs the responding hosts' IP and MAC addresses or (if requested) adds themas targets.  Root privileges on UNIX are required to run this script since ituses raw sockets.  Most operating systems don't respond to broadcast-pingprobes, but they can be configured to do so.The interface on which is broadcasted can be specified using the -e Nmap optionor the [code]broadcast-ping.interface[/code] script-arg. If no interface isspecified this script broadcasts on all ethernet interfaces which have an IPv4address defined.The [code]newtarget[/code] script-arg can be used so the script adds thediscovered IPs as targets.The timeout of the ICMP probes can be specified using the [code]timeout[/code]script-arg. The default timeout is 3000 ms. A higher number might be necessarywhen scanning across larger networks.The number of sent probes can be specified using the [code]num-probes[/code]script-arg. The default number is 1. A higher value might get more results onlarger networks.The ICMP probes sent comply with the --ttl and --data-length Nmap options, soyou can use those to control the TTL(time to live) and ICMP payload lengthrespectively. The default value for TTL is 64, and the length of the payloadis 0. The payload is consisted of random bytes.

 Sends a DHCPINFORM request to a host on UDP port 67 to obtain all the local configuration parameterswithout allocating a new address.DHCPINFORM is a DHCP request that returns useful information from a DHCP server, without allocating an IPaddress. The request sends a list of which fields it wants to know (a handful by default, every field ifverbosity is turned on), and the server responds with the fields that were requested. It should be notedthat the server doesn't have to return every field, nor does it have to return them in the same order,or honour the request at all. A Linksys WRT54g, for example, completely ignores the list of requestedfields and returns a few standard ones. This script displays every field it receives.With script arguments, the type of DHCP request can be changed, which can lead to interesting results.Additionally, the MAC address can be randomized, which in should override the cache on the DHCP server andassign a new IP address. Extra requests can also be sent to exhaust the IP address range more quickly.Some of the more useful fields:  DHCP Server (the address of the server that responded)  Subnet Mask  Router  DNS Servers  Hostname

 Performs DNS cache snooping against a DNS server.There are two modes of operation, controlled by the[code]dns-cache-snoop.mode[/code] script argument. In[code]nonrecursive[/code] mode (the default), queries are sent to theserver with the RD (recursion desired) flag set to 0. The server shouldrespond positively to these only if it has the domain cached. In[code]timed[/code] mode, the mean and standard deviation response timesfor a cached domain are calculated by sampling the resolution of a name(www.google.com) several times. Then, each domain is resolved and thetime taken compared to the mean. If it is less than one standarddeviation over the mean, it is considered cached. The [code]timed[/code]mode inserts entries in the cache and can only be used reliably once.The default list of domains to check consists of the top 50 most popularsites, each site being listed twice, once with "www." and once without.Use the [code]dns-cache-snoop.domains[/code] script argument to use adifferent list.

* Source: [fingerprint-strings.nse](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/fingerprint-strings.nse)
* Categories: version 

 Prints the readable strings from service fingerprints of unknown services.Nmap's service and application version detection engine sends named probes totarget services and tries to identify them based on the response. When there isno match, Nmap produces a service fingerprint for submission. Sometimes,inspecting this fingerprint can give clues as to the identity of the service.However, the fingerprint is encoded and wrapped to ensure it doesn't lose data,which can make it hard to read.This script simply unwraps the fingerprint and prints the readable ASCII stringsit finds below the name of the probe it responded to. The probe names are takenfrom the nmap-service-probes file, not from the response.

## firewalk.nse

* Categories: safe,discovery 

 Tries to discover firewall rules using an IP TTL expiration technique knownas firewalking.To determine a rule on a given gateway, the scanner sends a probe to a metriclocated behind the gateway, with a TTL one higher than the gateway. If the probeis forwarded by the gateway, then we can expect to receive an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDEDreply from the gateway next hop router, or eventually the metric itself if it isdirectly connected to the gateway. Otherwise, the probe will timeout.It starts with a TTL equals to the distance to the target. If the probe timeout,then it is resent with a TTL decreased by one. If we get an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED,then the scan is over for this probe.Every "no-reply" filtered TCP and UDP ports are probed. As for UDP scans, thisprocess can be quite slow if lots of ports are blocked by a gateway close to thescanner.Scan parameters can be controlled using the [code]firewalk. [/code]optional arguments.From an original idea of M. Schiffman and D. Goldsmith, authors of thefirewalk tool.

## firewall-bypass.nse

* Categories: vuln,intrusive 

 Detects a vulnerability in netfilter and other firewalls that use helpers todynamically open ports for protocols such as ftp and sip.The script works by spoofing a packet from the target server asking for openinga related connection to a target port which will be fulfilled by the firewallthrough the adequate protocol helper port. The attacking machine should be onthe same network segment as the firewall for this to work. The script supportsftp helper on both IPv4 and IPv6. Real path filter is used to prevent suchattacks.Based on work done by Eric Leblond.For more information, see:  http://home.regit.org/2012/03/playing-with-network-layers-to-bypass-firewalls-filtering-policy/

Without one an attacker may forge malicious requests.To recognize a token in a form, the script will iterate through the form'sattributes and will search for common patterns in their names. If that fails, itwill also calculate the entropy of each attribute's value. A big entropy means apossible token.A common use case for this script comes along with a cookie that gives accessin pages that require authentication, because that's where the privilegedexist. See the http library's documentation to set your own cookie.

* Categories: discovery,auth,intrusive 

 Tests for access with default credentials used by a variety of web applications and devices.It works similar to http-enum, we detect applications by matching known paths and launching a login routine using default credentials when found.This script depends on a fingerprint file containing the target's information: name, category, location paths, default credentials and login routine.You may select a category if you wish to reduce the number of requests. We have categories like:  [code]web[/code] - Web applications  [code]routers[/code] - Routers  [code]security[/code] - CCTVs and other security devices  [code]industrial[/code] - Industrial systems  [code]printer[/code] - Network-attached printers and printer servers  [code]storage[/code] - Storage devices  [code]virtualization[/code] - Virtualization systems  [code]console[/code] - Remote consolesYou can also select a specific fingerprint or a brand, such as BIG-IQ or Siemens. This matching is based on case-insensitive words. This means that "nas" will select Seagate BlackArmor NAS storage but not Netgear ReadyNAS.For a fingerprint to be used it needs to satisfy both the category and name criteria.By default, the script produces output only when default credentials are found, while staying silent when the target only matches some fingerprints (but no credentials are found). With increased verbosity (option -v), the script will also report all matching fingerprints.Please help improve this script by adding new entries to nselib/data/http-default-accounts.luaRemember each fingerprint must have:  [code]name[/code] - Descriptive name  [code]category[/code] - Category  [code]login_combos[/code] - Table of login combinations  [code]paths[/code] - Table containing possible path locations of the target  [code]login_check[/code] - Login function of the targetIn addition, a fingerprint should have:  [code]target_check[/code] - Target validation function. If defined, it will be called to validate the target before attempting any logins.

 Enumerates directories used by popular web applications and servers.This parses a fingerprint file that's similar in format to the Nikto Web applicationscanner. This script, however, takes it one step further by building in advanced pattern matching as wellas having the ability to identify specific versions of Web applications.You can also parse a Nikto-formatted database using http-fingerprints.nikto-db-path. This will try to parsemost of the fingerprints defined in nikto's database in real time. More documentation about this in thenselib/data/http-fingerprints.lua file.Currently, the database can be found under Nmap's directory in the nselib/data folder. The file is calledhttp-fingerprints and has a long description of its functionality in the file header.Many of the finger prints were discovered by me (Ron Bowes), and a number of them are from the Yokosoproject, used with permission from Kevin Johnson (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0685.html).Initially, this script attempts to access two different random files in order to detect serversthat don't return a proper 404 Not Found status. In the event that they return 200 OK, the bodyhas any non-static-looking data removed (URI, time, etc), and saved. If the two random attemptsreturn different results, the script aborts (since a 200-looking 404 cannot be distinguished froman actual 200). This will prevent most false positives.In addition, if the root folder returns a 301 Moved Permanently or 401 Authentication Required,this script will also abort. If the root folder has disappeared or requires authentication, thereis little hope of finding anything inside it.By default, only pages that return 200 OK or 401 Authentication Required are displayed. If the[code]http-enum.displayall[/code] script argument is set, however, then all results will be displayed (exceptfor 404 Not Found and the status code returned by the random files). Entries in the http-fingerprintsdatabase can specify their own criteria for accepting a page as valid.

* Categories: intrusive,brute 

 Performs brute force password auditing against http form-based authentication.This script uses the unpwdb and brute libraries to perform passwordguessing. Any successful guesses are stored in the nmap registry, usingthe creds library, for other scripts to use.The script automatically attempts to discover the form method, action, andfield names to use in order to perform password guessing. (Use argumentpath to specify the page where the form resides.) If it fails doing sothe form components can be supplied using arguments method, path, uservar,and passvar. The same arguments can be used to selectively overridethe detection outcome.The script contains a small database of known web apps' form information. Thisimproves form detection and also allows for form mangling and custom successdetection functions. If the script arguments aren't expressive enough, usersare encouraged to edit the database to fit.After attempting to authenticate using a HTTP GET or POST request the scriptanalyzes the response and attempts to determine whether authentication wassuccessful or not. The script analyzes this by checking the response usingthe following rules:1. If the response was empty the authentication was successful.2. If the onsuccess argument was provided then the authentication either   succeeded or failed depending on whether the response body contained   the message/pattern passed in the onsuccess argument.3. If no onsuccess argument was passed, and if the onfailure argument   was provided then the authentication either succeeded or failed   depending on whether the response body does not contain   the message/pattern passed in the onfailure argument.4. If neither the onsuccess nor onfailure argument was passed and the   response contains a form field named the same as the submitted   password parameter then the authentication failed.5. Authentication was successful.

 Tests a web server for vulnerability to the Slowloris DoS attack withoutactually launching a DoS attack.Slowloris was described at Defcon 17 by RSnake(see http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/).This script opens two connections to the server, each without the final CRLF.After 10 seconds, second connection sends additional header. Both connectionsthen wait for server timeout.  If second connection gets a timeout 10 or moreseconds after the first one, we can conclude that sending additional headerprolonged its timeout and that the server is vulnerable to slowloris DoSattack.A "LIKELY VULNERABLE" result means a server is subject to timeout-extensionattack, but depending on the http server's architecture and resource limits, afull denial-of-service is not always possible. Complete testing requirestriggering the actual DoS condition and measuring server responsiveness.You can specify custom http User-agent field with [code]http.useragent[/code]script argument.Idea from Qualys blogpost:  https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2011/07/07/identifying-slow-http-attack-vulnerabilities-on-web-applications Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and holdthem open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections tothe target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starvesthe http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

 Attempts to determine whether a web server is protected by an IPS (IntrusionPrevention System), IDS (Intrusion Detection System) or WAF (Web ApplicationFirewall) by probing the web server with malicious payloads and detectingchanges in the response code and body.To do this the script will send a "good" request and record the response,afterwards it will match this response against new requests containingmalicious payloads. In theory, web applications shouldn't react to maliciousrequests because we are storing the payloads in a variable that is not used bythe script/file and only WAF/IDS/IPS should react to it.  If aggro mode is set,the script will try all attack vectors (More noisy)This script can detect numerous IDS, IPS, and WAF products since they oftenprotect web applications in the same way.  But it won't detect products whichdon't alter the http traffic.

Subsequent connections with the sameclient name may then use the same PIN without user interaction.  If no PIN hasbeen set for the session, each PIN attempt will result in a new prompt in the"Impress Remote" menu. Brute-forcing the PIN, therefore, requires that the userhas entered a PIN for the same client name, and will result in lots of extraprompts in the "Impress Remote" menu.

 Detects the Murmur service (server for the Mumble voice communicationclient) versions 1.2.X.The Murmur server listens on a TCP (control) and a UDP (voice) portwith the same port number. This script activates on both a TCP and UDPport version scan. In both cases probe data is sent only to the UDPport because it allows for a simple and informative ping command.The single probe will report on the server version, current usercount, maximum users allowed on the server, and bandwidth used forvoice communication. It is used by the Mumble client to ping knownMurmur servers.The IP address from which service detection is being ran will mostlikely be temporarily banned by the target Murmur server due tomultiple incorrect handshakes (Nmap service probes). This ban makesidentifying the service via TCP impossible in practice, but does notaffect the UDP probe used by this script.It is possible to get a corrupt user count (usually +1) when doing aTCP service scan due to previous service probe connections affectingthe server.See http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Protocol.

 Obtains and prints an NTP server's monitor data.Monitor data is a list of the most recently used (MRU) having NTP associationswith the target. Each record contains information about the most recent NTPpacket sent by a host to the target including the source and destinationaddresses and the NTP version and mode of the packet. With this information itis possible to classify associated hosts as Servers, Peers, and Clients.A Peers command is also sent to the target and the peers list in the responseallows differentiation between configured Mode 1 Peers and clients which actlike Peers (such as the Windows W32Time service).Associated hosts are further classified as either public or private.Private hosts are thosehaving IP addresses which are not routable on the public Internet and thus canhelp to form a picture about the topology of the private network on which thetarget resides.Other information revealed by the monlist and peers commands are the host withwhich the target clock is synchronized and hosts which send Control Mode (6)and Private Mode (7) commands to the target and which may be used by admins forthe NTP service.It should be noted that the very nature of the NTP monitor data means that theMode 7 commands sent by this script are recorded by the target (and will oftenappear in these results). Since the monitor data is a MRU list, it is probablethat you can overwrite the record of the Mode 7 command by sending an innocuouslooking Client Mode request. This can be achieved easily using Nmap:[code]nmap -sU -pU:123 -Pn -n --max-retries

 Performs brute force password auditing against Oracle servers.Running it in default mode it performs an audit against a list of commonOracle usernames and passwords. The mode can be changed by supplying theargument oracle-brute.nodefault at which point the script will use theusername- and password- lists supplied with Nmap. Custom username- andpassword- lists may be supplied using the userdb and passdb arguments.The default credential list can be changed too by using the brute.credfileargument. In case the userdb or passdb arguments are supplied, the scriptassumes that it should run in the nodefault mode.In modern versions of Oracle password guessing speeds decrease after a fewguesses and remain slow, due to connection throttling.WARNING: The script makes no attempt to discover the amount of guessesthat can be made before locking an account. Running this script may thereforresult in a large number of accounts being locked out on the database server.

 Detects the version of an Oracle Virtual Server Agent by fingerprintingresponses to an HTTP GET request and an XML-RPC method call.Version 2.2 of Virtual Server Agent returns a distinctive string in response to anHTTP GET request. However versions 3.0 and 3.0.1 return a generic response thatlooks like any other BaseHTTP/SimpleXMLRPCServer. Versions 2.2 and 3.0 return adistinctive error message in response to a [code]system.listMethods[/code]XML-RPC call, which however does not distinguish the two versions. Version 3.0.1returns a response to [code]system.listMethods[/code] that is different fromthat of both version 2.2 and 3.0. Therefore we use this strategy: (1.) Send aGET request. If the version 2.2 string is returned, return "2.2". (2.) Send a[code]system.listMethods[/code] method call. If an error isreturned, return "3.0" or "3.0.1", depending on the specific format of theerror.

## p2p-conficker.nse

* Source: [p2p-conficker.nse](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/p2p-conficker.nse)
* Categories: default,safe 

 Checks if a host is infected with Conficker.C or higher, based onConficker's peer to peer communication.When Conficker.C or higher infects a system, it opens four ports: two TCPand two UDP. The ports are random, but are seeded with the current week andthe IP of the infected host. By determining the algorithm, one can check ifthese four ports are open, and can probe them for more data.Once the open ports are found, communication can be initiated usingConficker's custom peer to peer protocol.  If a valid response is received,then a valid Conficker infection has been found.This check won't work properly on a multihomed or NATed system because theopen ports will be based on a nonpublic IP.  The argument[code]checkall[/code] tells Nmap to attempt communication with every openport (much like a version check) and the argument [code]realip[/code] tellsNmap to base its port generation on the given IP address instead of theactual IP.By default, this will run against a system that has a standard Windows portopen (445, 139, 137). The arguments [code]checkall[/code] and[code]checkconficker[/code] will both perform checks regardless of whichport is open, see the args section for more information.Note: Ensure your clock is correct (within a week) before using this script

## path-mtu.nse

* Source: [path-mtu.nse](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/path-mtu.nse)
* Categories: safe,discovery 

 Performs simple Path MTU Discovery to target hosts.TCP or UDP packets are sent to the host with the DF (don't fragment) bit setand with varying amounts of data.  If an ICMP Fragmentation Needed is received,or no reply is received after retransmissions, the amount of data is loweredand another packet is sent.  This continues until (assuming no errors occur) areply from the final host is received, indicating the packet reached the hostwithout being fragmented.Not all MTUs are attempted so as to not expend too much time or networkresources.  Currently the relatively short list of MTUs to try containsthe plateau values from Table 7-1 in RFC 1191, "Path MTU Discovery".Using these values significantly cuts down the MTU search space.  On topof that, this list is rarely traversed in whole because:  the MTU of the outgoing interface is used as a starting point, and  we can jump down the list when an intermediate router sending a "can't fragment" message includes its next hop MTU (as described in RFC 1191 and required by RFC 1812)

* Categories: safe,discovery 

 Repeatedly probe open and/or closed ports on a host to obtain a seriesof round-trip time values for each port.  These values are used togroup collections of ports which are statistically different from othergroups.  Ports being in different groups (or "families") may be due tonetwork mechanisms such as port forwarding to machines behind a NAT.In order to group these ports into different families, some statisticalvalues must be computed.  Among these values are the mean and standarddeviation of the round-trip times for each port.  Once all of the timeshave been recorded and these values have been computed, the Student'st-test is used to test the statistical significance of the differencesbetween each port's data.  Ports which have round-trip times that arestatistically the same are grouped together in the same family.This script is based on Doug Hoyte's Qscan documentation and patchesfor Nmap.

 Checks if a machine is vulnerable to MS12-020 RDP vulnerability.The Microsoft bulletin MS12-020 patches two vulnerabilities: CVE-2012-0152which addresses a denial of service vulnerability inside Terminal Server, andCVE-2012-0002 which fixes a vulnerability in Remote Desktop Protocol. Both arepart of Remote Desktop Services.The script works by checking for the CVE-2012-0152 vulnerability. If thisvulnerability is not patched, it is assumed that CVE-2012-0002 is not patchedeither. This script can do its check without crashing the target.The way this works follows:  Send one user request. The server replies with a user id (call it A) and a channel for that user.  Send another user request. The server replies with another user id (call it B) and another channel.  Send a channel join request with requesting user set to A and requesting channel set to B. If the server replies with a success message, we conclude that the server is vulnerable.  In case the server is vulnerable, send a channel join request with the requesting user set to B and requesting channel set to B to prevent the chance of a crash.References:  http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-020  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2621440  http://zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-044/  http://aluigi.org/adv/termdd_1-adv.txtOriginal check by by Worawit Wang (sleepya).

 Attempts to guess username/password combinations over SMB, storing discovered combinationsfor use in other scripts. Every attempt will be made to get a valid list of users and toverify each username before actually using them. When a username is discovered, besidesbeing printed, it is also saved in the Nmap registry so other Nmap scripts can use it. Thatmeans that if you're going to run [code]smb-brute.nse[/code], you should run other [code]smb[/code] scripts you want.This checks passwords in a case-insensitive way, determining case after a password is found,for Windows versions before Vista.This script is specifically targeted towards security auditors or penetration testers.One example of its use, suggested by Brandon Enright, was hooking up [code]smb-brute.nse[/code] to thedatabase of usernames and passwords used by the Conficker worm (the password list can befound at http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords, among other places.Then, the network is scanned and all systems that would be infected by Conficker arediscovered.From the penetration tester perspective its use is pretty obvious.

 Attempts to enumerate domains on a system, along with their policies. This generally requirescredentials, except against Windows 2000. In addition to the actual domain, the "Builtin"domain is generally displayed. Windows returns this in the list of domains, but its policiesdon't appear to be used anywhere.Much of the information provided is useful to a penetration tester, because it tells thetester what types of policies to expect. For example, if passwords have a minimum length of 8,the tester can trim his database to match; if the minimum length is 14, the tester willprobably start looking for sticky notes on people's monitors.Another useful piece of information is the password lockouts. A penetration tester often wantsto know whether or not there's a risk of negatively impacting a network, and this willindicate it. The SID is displayed, which may be useful in other tools; the users are listed,which uses different functions than [code]smb-enum-users.nse[/code] (though likely won'tget different results), and the date and time the domain was created may give some insight intoits history.After the initial [code]bind[/code] to SAMR, the sequence of calls is:  [code]Connect4[/code]: get a connect_handle  [code]EnumDomains[/code]: get a list of the domains (stop here if you just want the names).  [code]QueryDomain[/code]: get the SID for the domain.  [code]OpenDomain[/code]: get a handle for each domain.  [code]QueryDomainInfo2[/code]: get the domain information.

Keepin mind that MSRPC refers to groups as "Aliases".  [code]Bind[/code]: bind to the SAMR service.  [code]Connect4[/code]: get a connect_handle.  [code]EnumDomains[/code]: get a list of the domains.  [code]LookupDomain[/code]: get the RID of the domains.  [code]OpenDomain[/code]: get a handle for each domain.  [code]EnumDomainAliases[/code]: get the list of groups in the domain.  [code]OpenAlias[/code]: get a handle to each group.  [code]GetMembersInAlias[/code]: get the RIDs of the members in the groups.  [code]Close[/code]: close the alias handle.  [code]Close[/code]: close the domain handle.  [code]Close[/code]: close the connect handle.Once the RIDs have been termined, the  [code]Bind[/code]: bind to the LSA service.  [code]OpenPolicy2[/code]: get a policy handle.  [code]LookupSids2[/code]: convert SIDs to usernames.I (Ron Bowes) originally looked into the possibility of using the SAMR function [code]LookupRids2[/code]to convert RIDs to usernames, but the function seemed to return a fault no matter what I tried.

 Enumerates the users logged into a system either locally or through an SMB share. The local userscan be logged on either physically on the machine, or through a terminal services session.Connections to a SMB share are, for example, people connected to fileshares or making RPC calls.Nmap's connection will also show up, and is generally identified by the one that connected "0seconds ago".From the perspective of a penetration tester, the SMB Sessions is probably the most usefulpart of this program, especially because it doesn't require a high level of access. On, forexample, a file server, there might be a dozen or more users connected at the same time. Basedon the usernames, it might tell the tester what types of files are stored on the share.Since the IP they're connected from and the account is revealed, the information here can alsoprovide extra targets to test, as well as a username that's likely valid on that target. Additionally,since a strong username to ip correlation is given, it can be a boost to a social engineeringattack.Enumerating the logged in users is done by reading the remote registry (and therefore won'twork against Vista, which disables it by default). Keys stored under [code]HKEY_USERS[/code] areSIDs that represent the connected users, and those SIDs can be converted to proper names by usingthe [code]lsar.LsaLookupSids[/code] function. Doing this requires any access higher thananonymous; guests, users, or administrators are all able to perform this request on Windows 2000,XP, 2003, and Vista.Enumerating SMB connections is done using the [code]srvsvc.netsessenum[/code] function, whichreturns the usernames that are logged in, when they logged in, and how long they've been idlefor. The level of access required for this varies between Windows versions, but in Windows2000 anybody (including the anonymous account) can access this, and in Windows 2003 a useror administrator account is required.I learned the idea and technique for this from Sysinternals' tool, [code]PsLoggedOn.exe[/code]. I (RonBowes) use similar function calls to what they use (although I didn't use their source),so thanks go out to them. Thanks also to Matt Gardenghi, for requesting this script.WARNING: I have experienced crashes in regsvc.exe while making registry callsagainst a fully patched Windows 2000 system; I've fixed the issue that caused it,but there's no guarantee that it (or a similar vuln in the same code) won't showup again.

 Attempts to list shares using the [code]srvsvc.NetShareEnumAll[/code] MSRPC function andretrieve more information about them using [code]srvsvc.NetShareGetInfo[/code]. If accessto those functions is denied, a list of common share names are checked.Finding open shares is useful to a penetration tester because there may be private filesshared, or, if it's writable, it could be a good place to drop a Trojan or to infect a filethat's already there. Knowing where the share is could make those kinds of tests more useful,except that determining where the share is requires administrative privileges already.Running [code]NetShareEnumAll[/code] will work anonymously against Windows 2000, andrequires a user-level account on any other Windows version. Calling [code]NetShareGetInfo[/code]requires an administrator account on all versions of Windows up to 2003, as well as Windows Vistaand Windows 7, if UAC is turned down.Even if [code]NetShareEnumAll[/code] is restricted, attempting to connect to a share will alwaysreveal its existence. So, if [code]NetShareEnumAll[/code] fails, a pre-generated list of shares,based on a large test network, are used. If any of those succeed, they are recorded.After a list of shares is found, the script attempts to connect to each of them anonymously,which divides them into "anonymous", for shares that the NULL user can connect to, or "restricted",for shares that require a user account.

 Attempts to enumerate the users on a remote Windows system, with as muchinformation as possible, through two different techniques (both over MSRPC,which uses port 445 or 139; see [code]smb.lua[/code]). The goal of this scriptis to discover all user accounts that exist on a remote system. This can behelpful for administration, by seeing who has an account on a server, or forpenetration testing or network footprinting, by determining which accountsexist on a system.A penetration tester who is examining servers may wish to determine thepurpose of a server. By getting a list of who has access to it, the testermight get a better idea (if financial people have accounts, it probablyrelates to financial information). Additionally, knowing which accountsexist on a system (or on multiple systems) allows the pen-tester to build adictionary of possible usernames for bruteforces, such as a SMB bruteforceor a Telnet bruteforce. These accounts may be helpful for other purposes,such as using the accounts in Web applications on this or other servers.From a pen-testers perspective, retrieving the list of users on anygiven server creates endless possibilities.Users are enumerated in two different ways:  using SAMR enumeration orLSA bruteforcing. By default, both are used, but they have specificadvantages and disadvantages. Using both is a great default, but in certaincircumstances it may be best to give preference to one.Advantages of using SAMR enumeration:  Stealthier (requires one packet/user account, whereas LSA uses at least 10 packets while SAMR uses half that; additionally, LSA makes a lot of noise in the Windows event log (LSA enumeration is the only script I (Ron Bowes) have been called on by the administrator of a box I was testing against).  More information is returned (more than just the username).  Every account will be found, since they're being enumerated with a function that's designed to enumerate users.Advantages of using LSA bruteforcing:  More accounts are returned (system accounts, groups, and aliases are returned, not just users).  Requires a lower-level account to run on Windows XP and higher (a 'guest' account can be used, whereas SAMR enumeration requires a 'user' account; especially useful when only guest access is allowed, or when an account has a blank password (which effectively gives it guest access)).SAMR enumeration is done with the  [code]QueryDisplayInfo[/code] function.If this succeeds, it will return a detailed list of users, along with descriptions,types, and full names. This can be done anonymously against Windows 2000, andwith a user-level account on other Windows versions (but not with a guest-level account).To perform this test, the following functions are used:  [code]Bind[/code]: bind to the SAMR service.  [code]Connect4[/code]: get a connect_handle.  [code]EnumDomains[/code]: get a list of the domains.  [code]QueryDomain[/code]: get the sid for the domain.  [code]OpenDomain[/code]: get a handle for each domain.  [code]QueryDisplayInfo[/code]: get the list of users in the domain.  [code]Close[/code]: Close the domain handle.  [code]Close[/code]: Close the connect handle.The advantage of this technique is that a lot of details are returned, includingthe full name and description; the disadvantage is that it requires a user-levelaccount on every system except for Windows 2000. Additionally, it only pulls actualuser accounts, not groups or aliases.Regardless of whether this succeeds, a second technique is used to pulluser accounts, called LSA bruteforcing. LSA bruteforcing can be done anonymouslyagainst Windows 2000, and requires a guest account or better on other systems.It has the advantage of running with less permission, and will also find moreaccount types (i.e., groups, aliases, etc.). The disadvantages is that it returnsless information, and that, because it's a brute-force guess, it's possible to missaccounts. It's also extremely noisy.This isn't a brute-force technique in the common sense, however: it's a brute-forcing of users'RIDs. A user's RID is a value (generally 500, 501, or 1000+) that uniquely identifiesa user on a domain or system. An LSA function is exposed which lets us convert the RID(say, 1000) to the username (say, "Ron"). So, the technique will essentially tryconverting 1000 to a name, then 1001, 1002, etc., until we think we're done.To do this, the script breaks users into groups of RIDs based on the [code]LSA_GROUPSIZE[/code]constant. All members of this group are checked simultaneously, and the responses recorded.When a series of empty groups are found ([code]LSA_MINEMPTY[/code] groups, specifically),the scan ends. As long as you are getting a few groups with active accounts, the scan willcontinue.Before attempting this conversion, the SID of the server has to be determined.The SID is determined by doing the reverse operation; that is, by converting a name intoits RID. The name is determined by looking up any name present on the system.We try:  The computer name and domain name, returned in [code]SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE[/code];  An nbstat query to get the server name and the user currently logged in; and  Some common names: "administrator", "guest", and "test".In theory, the computer name should be sufficient for this to always work, andit has so far has in my tests, but I included the rest of the names for good measure. Itdoesn't hurt to add more.The names and details from both of these techniques are merged and displayed.If the output is verbose, then extra details are shown. The output is ordered alphabetically.Credit goes out to the [code]enum.exe[/code], [code]sid2user.exe[/code], and[code]user2sid.exe[/code] programs for pioneering some of the techniques usedin this script.

 Exhausts a remote SMB server's connection limit by by opening as manyconnections as we can.  Most implementations of SMB have a hard globallimit of 11 connections for user accounts and 10 connections foranonymous. Once that limit is reached, further connections aredenied. This script exploits that limit by taking up all theconnections and holding them.This works better with a valid user account, because Windows reservesone slot for valid users. So, no matter how many anonymous connectionsare taking up spaces, a single valid user can still log in.This is  not  recommended as a general purpose script, because a) itis designed to harm the server and has no useful output, and b) itnever ends (until timeout).

 Attempts to determine the operating system, computer name, domain, workgroup, and currenttime over the SMB protocol (ports 445 or 139).This is done by starting a session with the anonymousaccount (or with a proper user account, if one is given; it likely doesn't makea difference); in response to a session starting, the server will send back all thisinformation.The following fields may be included in the output, depending on thecircumstances (e.g. the workgroup name is mutually exclusive with domain and forestnames) and the information available:  OS  Computer name  Domain name  Forest name  FQDN  NetBIOS computer name  NetBIOS domain name  Workgroup  System timeSome systems, like Samba, will blank out their name (and only send their domain).Other systems (like embedded printers) will simply leave out the information. Othersystems will blank out various pieces (some will send back 0 for the currenttime, for example).If this script is used in conjunction with version detection it can augment thestandard nmap version detection information with data that this script has discovered.Retrieving the name and operating system of a server is a vital step in targetingan attack against it, and this script makes that retrieval easy.

 Returns information about the SMB security level determined by SMB.Here is how to interpret the output:  User-level authentication: Each user has a separate username/password that  is used to log into the system. This is the default setup of pretty much  everything these days.  Share-level authentication: The anonymous account should be used to log  in, then the password is given (in plaintext) when a share is accessed.  All users who have access to the share use this password. This was the  original way of doing things, but isn't commonly seen, now. If a server  uses share-level security, it is vulnerable to sniffing.  Challenge/response passwords supported: If enabled, the server can accept  any type of password (plaintext, LM and NTLM, and LMv2 and NTLMv2).  If it  isn't set, the server can only accept plaintext passwords. Most servers  are configured to use challenge/response these days. If a server is  configured to accept plaintext passwords, it is vulnerable to sniffing. LM  and NTLM are fairly secure, although there are some brute-force attacks  against them.  Additionally, LM and NTLM can fall victim to  man-in-the-middle attacks or relay attacks (see MS08-068 or my writeup of  it: http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/

 Checks if target machines are vulnerable to the arbitrary shared library loadvulnerability CVE-2017-7494.Unpatched versions of Samba from 3.5.0 to 4.4.13, and versions prior to4.5.10 and 4.6.4 are affected by a vulnerability that allows remote codeexecution, allowing a malicious client to upload a shared library to a writableshare, and then cause the server to load and execute it.The script does not scan the version numbers by default as the patches releasedfor the mainstream Linux distributions do not change the version numbers.The script checks the preconditions for the exploit to happen:1)  If the argument check-version is applied, the script will ONLY check    services running potentially vulnerable versions of Samba, and run the    exploit against those services. This is useful if you wish to scan a    group of hosts quickly for the vulnerability based on the version number.    However, because of their version number, some patched versions may still    show up as likely vulnerable. Here, we use smb.get_os(host) to do    versioning of the Samba version and compare it to see if it is a known    vulnerable version of Samba. Note that this check is not conclusive:    See 2,3,42)  Whether there exists writable shares for the execution of the script.    We must be able to write to a file to the share for the exploit to    take place. We hence enumerate the shares using    smb.share_find_writable(host) which returns the main_name, main_path    and a list of writable shares.3)  Whether the workaround (disabling of named pipes) was applied. All versions of Samba from 3.5.0 onwards are vulnerable to a remotecode execution vulnerability, allowing a malicious client to upload ashared library to a writable share, and then cause the server to loadand execute it.

 Detects whether a server is vulnerable to the SSL/TLS "CCS Injection"vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224), first discovered by Masashi Kikuchi.The script is based on the ccsinjection.c code authored by Ramon de C Valle(https://gist.github.com/rcvalle/71f4b027d61a78c42607)In order to exploit the vulnerablity, a MITM attacker would effectivelydo the following:    o Wait for a new TLS connection, followed by the ClientHello      ServerHello handshake messages.    o Issue a CCS packet in both the directions, which causes the OpenSSL      code to use a zero length pre master secret key. The packet is sent      to both ends of the connection. Session Keys are derived using a      zero length pre master secret key, and future session keys also      share this weakness.    o Renegotiate the handshake parameters.    o The attacker is now able to decrypt or even modify the packets      in transit.The script works by sending a 'ChangeCipherSpec' message out of order andchecking whether the server returns an 'UNEXPECTED_MESSAGE' alert recordor not. Since a non-patched server would simply accept this message, theCCS packet is sent twice, in order to force an alert from the server. Ifthe alert type is different than 'UNEXPECTED_MESSAGE', we can concludethe server is vulnerable.description OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1hdoes not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages,which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zerolength master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, andconsequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, viaa crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use anonymousDiffie-Hellman key exchange only provide protection against passiveeavesdropping, and are vulnerable to active man-in-the-middle attackswhich could completely compromise the confidentiality and integrity The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol contains a flaw that istriggered when handling Diffie-Hellman key exchanges defined withthe DHE_EXPORT cipher. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attackerto downgrade the security of a TLS session to 512-bit export-gradecryptography, which is significantly weaker, allowing the attackerto more easily break the encryption and monitor or tamper with Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use Diffie-Hellman groupsof insufficient strength, especially those using one of a few commonly This TLS service appears to be using a modulus that is not a safe primeand does not correspond to any well-known DSA group for Diffie-Hellmankey exchange.These parameters MAY be secure if:- They were generated according to the procedure described in  FIPS 186-4 for DSA Domain Parameter Generation, or- The generator g generates a subgroup of large prime orderAdditional testing may be required to verify the security of theseparameters.

The get_client_master_key function in s2_srvr.c in the SSLv2 implementation in      OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before      1.0.2a accepts a nonzero CLIENT-MASTER-KEY CLEAR-KEY-LENGTH value for an arbitrary      cipher, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to determine the MASTER-KEY value      and decrypt TLS ciphertext data by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, a      related issue to CVE-2016-0800.       The SSLv2 protocol, as used in OpenSSL before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g and      other products, requires a server to send a ServerVerify message before establishing      that a client possesses certain plaintext RSA data, which makes it easier for remote      attackers to decrypt TLS ciphertext data by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding      oracle, aka a "DROWN" attack.

This should be followed up with ordinary ND host discovery toverify that the guessed addresses are correct.The router advertisement has a router lifetime of zero and a short prefixlifetime (a few seconds)See also:  RFC 4862, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, especially section 5.5.3.  https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/auxiliary/scanner/discovery/ipv6_neighbor_router_advertisement.rb

 Detects the Ventrilo voice communication server service versions 2.1.2and above and tries to determine version and configurationinformation. Some of the older versions (pre 3.0.0) may not have theUDP service that this probe relies on enabled by default.The Ventrilo server listens on a TCP (voice/control) and an UDP (ping/status)port with the same port number (fixed to 3784 in the free version, otherwiseconfigurable). This script activates on both a TCP and UDP port version scan.In both cases probe data is sent only to the UDP port because it allows for asimple and informative status command as implemented by the[code]ventrilo_status.exe[/code] executable which has shipped alongside the Windows serverpackage since version 2.1.2 when the UDP status service was implemented.When run as a version detection script ([code]-sV[/code]), the script will report on theserver version, name, uptime, authentication scheme, and OS.  When runexplicitly ([code]--script ventrilo-info[/code]), the script will additionally report on theserver name phonetic pronunciation string, the server comment, maximum numberof clients, voice codec, voice format, channel and client counts, and detailsabout channels and currently connected clients.Original reversing of the protocol was done by Luigi Auriemma(http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm#ventrilo).

## vulners.nse

 For each available CPE the script prints out known vulns (links to the correspondent info) and correspondent CVSS scores.Its work is pretty simple:  work only when some software version is identified for an open port  take all the known CPEs for that software (from the standard nmap -sV output)  make a request to a remote server (vulners.com API) to learn whether any known vulns exist for that CPE  if no info is found this way, try to get it using the software name alone  print the obtained info outNB:Since the size of the DB with all the vulns is more than 250GB there is no way to use a local db.So we do make requests to a remote service. Still all the requests contain just two fields - thesoftware name and its version (or CPE), so one can still have the desired privacy.

 Queries the WHOIS services of Regional Internet Registries (RIR) and attempts to retrieve information about the IP AddressAssignment which contains the Target IP Address.The fields displayed contain information about the assignment and the organisation responsible for managing the addressspace. When output verbosity is requested on the Nmap command line ([code]-v[/code]) extra information about the assignment willbe displayed.To determine which of the RIRs to query for a given Target IP Address this script utilises Assignments Data hosted by IANA.The data is cached locally and then parsed for use as a lookup table.  The locally cached files are refreshed periodicallyto help ensure the data is current.  If, for any reason, these files are not available to the script then a default sequenceof Whois services are queried in turn until: the desired record is found; or a referral to another (defined) Whois service isfound; or until the sequence is exhausted without finding either a referral or the desired record.The script will recognize a referral to another Whois service if that service is defined in the script and will continue bysending a query to the referred service.  A record is assumed to be the desired one if it does not contain a referral.To reduce the number unnecessary queries sent to Whois services a record cache is employed and the entries in the cache can beapplied to any targets within the range of addresses represented in the record.In certain circumstances, the ability to cache responses prevents the discovery of other, smaller IP address assignmentsapplicable to the target because a cached response is accepted in preference to sending a Whois query.  When it is importantto ensure that the most accurate information about the IP address assignment is retrieved the script argument [code]whodb[/code]should be used with a value of [code]"nocache"[/code] (see script arguments).  This reduces the range of addresses that may use acached record to a size that helps ensure that smaller assignments will be discovered.  This option should be used with cautiondue to the potential to send large numbers of whois queries and possibly be banned from using the services.In using this script your IP address will be sent to iana.org. Additionallyyour address and the address of the target of the scan will be sent to one ofthe RIRs.
